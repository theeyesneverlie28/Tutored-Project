# Before opening notebook file. Please Install the Following:

Anaconda 3.*
Python 3.*

# Objectives:
You will gain:

* Knowledge concerning statistical indicators to explore spatial data in Python.
** Variogram
** Autocorrelation
** Compute the slope from DTM map
** Intercorrelation (PCC coefficient)
** AGB Predicted model 
** MSE analysis on azimutal direction

* Experience with a data about DTM,AGB,FH in Python.
** Open tiff file
** Use matplotlib to display spatial maps

# Getting Started
Here's the steps to get setup locally with Anaconda for Python 3.*, common Python packages, Jupyter Notebooks:
* Install Anaconda 3.
* From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal.
* In the terminal type: 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. pip install GDAL.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. pip install sklearn.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. pip install numpy.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. pip install skgstat.</p>
