# Before opening notebook file. Please Install the Following:

Anaconda 3.*
Python 3.*

Here's the steps to get setup locally with Anaconda for Python 3.*, common Python packages, Jupyter Notebooks:
* Install Anaconda 3.
* From Anaconda Navigator (within Anaconda3 group), go to the environment tab, click on base (root) green arrow and open a terminal.
* In the terminal type: 
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      1. pip install GDAL.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      2. pip install sklearn.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      3. pip install numpy.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      4. pip install skgstat.</p>

# Objectives:
You will gain:

* Knowledge concerning statistical indicators to explore spatial data in Python.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      1. Variogram</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      2. Autocorrelation</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      3. Compute the slope from DTM map</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      4. Intercorrelation (PCC coefficient)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      5. AGB Predicted model </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      6. MSE analysis on azimutal direction</p>


* Experience with a data about DTM,AGB,FH in Python.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      1. Open tiff file</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;      2. Use matplotlib to display spatial maps</p>
